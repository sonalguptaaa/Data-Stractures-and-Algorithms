# Data-Stractures-and-Algorithms
I’m solving DSA problems every day and documenting the entire journey — from fundamentals to advanced topics. Each entry includes the problem link, my solution, and a brief explanation. The goal is consistent improvement, deeper understanding, and a transparent record of progress.

# 📘 Daily DSA Practice

This repository documents my consistent practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with the goal of building strong problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

## 🧩 Overview

- Daily problem-solving across core DSA topics
- Solutions written in C++ (with occasional Python)
- Clear explanations and approach breakdowns
- Structured and versioned for long-term reference

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Problem link and description
- 💻 Solution code
- 📝 Explanation or key insights

## 🎯 Objective

To build a strong foundation in DSA through disciplined practice, and maintain a transparent, well-documented record of my progress from beginner to advanced level.
