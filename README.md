# Data-Stractures-and-Algorithms
I’m solving DSA problems every day and documenting the entire journey — from fundamentals to advanced topics. Each entry includes the problem link, my solution, and a brief explanation. The goal is consistent improvement, deeper understanding, and a transparent record of progress.

#  Daily DSA Practice

This repository documents my consistent practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with the goal of building strong problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

##  Overview

- Daily problem-solving across core DSA topics
- Solutions written in C++ (with occasional Python)
- Clear explanations and approach breakdowns
- Structured and versioned for long-term reference

##  Structure

Each folder contains:
-  Problem link and description
-  Solution code
-  Explanation or key insights

##  Objective

To build a strong foundation in DSA through disciplined practice, and maintain a transparent, well-documented record of my progress from beginner to advanced level.
